# Polyrunner

An infinite runner, except there's (usually) no vertical gravity and the main mechanic is creating copies of yourself

Made for [Weekly Game Jam, Week 36 on itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/weekly-game-jam-36) (Twins)

### Objective

Avoid the spikes. Make copies of yourself to overcome certain obstacles.

### Controls

- Press W and S to move up and down. Note that all of your twins move simultaneously.
- Click anywhere to spawn a new twin at the cursor location.
- Press TAB to select the next twin, if present.
- Press SPACE to "detach" (lose control of) the selected twin. You can only do this is you have at least 2 twins on screen. Detached twins experience vertical gravity. Detach twins before they run into obstacles; if an attached twin runs into one you lose the game.
- Press ESC to pause/resume.
